Dear You,

This is our little constellation of moments, collected in a terminal window.
Every falling note is a tiny reminder that you make even quiet days feel vivid.

I hope this letter unlocks slowly, like the way we learned each other,
one smile at a time, one shared coffee, one small kindness that stayed.

Thank you for being my favorite person to build memories with.
May our next chapters be playful, patient, and full of warm light.

With love,
Me
